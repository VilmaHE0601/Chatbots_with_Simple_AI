# Chatbots_with_Simple_AI
WEEK 1
In my quest, my chatbot is named Dobby. when he is mentioned in Discord chat, it becomes more active. I wanted my chatbot to replicate as much as possible Dobby's tone of voice in the movie and to show that he is willing to listen to you about many things.
The bot will reproduce the classic "Dobby is a free elf" when certain keywords or emoticons are spoken.

Dobby will be a chatbot that is oriented towards being talked to and entertained. I think it will specifically use stylized buttons and emojis as UI elements added into the activation method to show its personality.
